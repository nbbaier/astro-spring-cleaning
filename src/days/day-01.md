title: "Day 1: Clear One Small Surface"
---

This whole one-day-at-a-time thing is about momentum. And if we started with a task like "deep clean your oven" I feel like we'd all burn out before we began. So we'll get the journey going with a single step: Choose one surface, somewhere in your home, and give it a thorough cleaning.

Your surface can be the top of a console table, one shelf on the wall, or even an entire bookcase, if you'd like. But make sure you choose something finite, and make sure it's not an overwhelming task: “the entire bookcase” is great if you mean a small IKEA piece, but not the built-ins in your 18-foot home library.

First take everything off the surface. If the bare surface looks visibly dusty or has debris, give it a once-over with a microfiber duster or your vacuum cleaner. Then give the surface a wipe-down with a rag and your favorite cleaner. All-purpose cleaner works great for many surfaces, but you can also use soapy water (mix a bit of dish detergent or castile soap into water—it's less a science than an art), or a half-and-half mix of white vinegar and water. Let the surface dry.

As you go to replace the objects on your shelf, dust and/or clean them off one by one as well. You can take this opportunity to re-arrange the objects, if that would make you happy. But if it feels overwhelming, you can just toss them back on in any old way (quite bohemian, actually) and marvel at this one impeccably clean area of your home.

That's it for today! Stop here and gear up for tomorrow's assignment.
