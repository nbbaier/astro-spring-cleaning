title: "Day 10: Clean Rugs and Floors"
---

Grab whatever tools you normally use to clean your floors, and get started! The ultimate challenge is to vacuum and pick up all the rugs, then clean every inch of floor before putting them back down. If that’s too much, it’s ok to clean in place, weaving around furniture as needed. Or you can choose to do the pick-it-all-up deep clean, but only in one room. It’s totally up to you!

**If you have rugs:**

-  Either vacuum them in place, or deep clean them by moving all the furniture off the rug, and flipping and vacuuming it from both sides a few times.
-  If you see any discoloration, spot-treat it by blotting at it with a carpet-cleaning spray or soapy water on a rag.

**If you have wall-to-wall carpets:**

-  Vacuum them like usual. If you have pets, you could also give them a rake-through with a pet hair glove or squeegee to get everything up out of the carpet fibers.
-  If you think your carpets need more love, leave yourself a reminder to rent or borrow a carpet cleaning machine, or hire professional carpet cleaners to come out when everything opens back up for business.

**If you have hardwoods, concrete, linoleum, or other hard-surface flooring:**

-  Sweep and/or vacuum your floors, moving or sliding furniture out of the way as you’re able, to do a really thorough job.
-  Follow up by mopping in your usual way, with your usual cleaner.

The last step—maybe the most important—is to marvel at your clean home and revel in the pride you feel at tackling some very important spring cleaning tasks off your list.
