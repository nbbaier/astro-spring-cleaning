# Day 6 Assignment: Clean the Windows

Gather up some supplies, and clean the windows. It’s that simple.

I use my favorite glass cleaner and a microfiber cloth on my window glass, then follow it up with a squeegee to get things instantly dry and streak-free (my squeegee is actually a small ice scraper because most of my windows are french-door-style panes, but a bigger squeegee will get the job done faster). If you don’t have glass cleaner around, it’s really easy to make your own: just combine equal parts white vinegar and water, then add a few drops of dish soap. If you have window screens, you might want to grab a lint roller, too—it makes easy work of cleaning them. Or make a heavy duty “lint roller” with duct tape and a paint roller. For a finishing touch, bring another rag and all-purpose cleaner so you can wipe the window molding, sills, and latches (a magic eraser works great, too—just spot test first).

Now that you’ve got your supplies, work around your house cleaning every window, one after another. If you can count your windows on one hand, this will be quick and simple. If you’ve got a bigger place, section out your work. Start at your front door, and follow the wall to the right, cleaning each window as you reach it, until you’re back at the front door. Do the same thing on your second level starting at the stairs.

When you’re done, put your supplies away, grab a treat for yourself (like a drink or a book) and do a little wistful window-gazing. You’ve earned it!
