title: "Day 3: Dust Up High"
---

The features above your head work hard to collect dust all year, even if you can’t see it. Today, grab a step stool or ladder and your favorite dusting tool and get to work. I use a long-reach microfiber duster tool, but you can use any old rag (drape it over the end of a broom handle if you can’t reach), or your vacuum, if that does a thorough enough job for you. In a pinch, a sock on the end of a broom handle makes a great extension-duster tool, too.

Work around your home (you can follow the wall from the front door if you’re concerned about losing track), and dust the molding and surfaces up high in your home, whatever’s usually above your head. Here are some things you might target:

-  Intricate crown molding or other up-high architectural features
-  Corners where walls meet
-  Ceiling air vents
-  Exposed ducts or pipes
-  Light fixtures
-  Ceiling fans
-  Tops of wall-mounted cabinets, in the kitchen or elsewhere
-  Tops of tall bookshelves
-  On top of the refrigerator
-  Pot racks or any similar storage solutions hanging from the ceiling or high on the wall
-  Tops of door casings
-  Tops of picture frames or mirrors
-  Curtain rods and finials

Dry dusting is probably enough for you to feel like these spaces have been refreshed, but if you want to get really into it in certain places, or you notice spots with built-up grime you can’t ignore, follow up your dry round with a spot treatment of all-purpose cleaner on a rag (again, use that broom handle if you can’t reach!). If you don’t have all-purpose cleaner, try soapy water (using dish detergent or castile soap), or a half-and-half mix of white vinegar and water.

You’ll probably need to vacuum up after yourself today, if you leave any debris below you. But now you’ve seen first-hand how cleaning top to bottom can save time during a marathon clean.
