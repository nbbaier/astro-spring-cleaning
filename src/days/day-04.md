title: "Day 4: Deep Clean One Appliance"
---

Appliances are something you might not think too hard about cleaning, besides the aesthetic stuff like wiping fingerprints off the fridge or cleaning splatters from inside the microwave. Today, choose one appliance—big or small—from anywhere in your home, and give it a really thorough deep clean.

Here are some ideas:

-  **Big kitchen appliances**, like a refrigerator, oven, stovetop and range hood, or dishwasher
-  **Small kitchen appliances**, like a microwave, coffee maker, toaster, toaster oven, electric kettle, slow cooker, air fryer, or stand mixer
-  **Laundry appliances**, like a washer, dryer, or hand steamer
-  **Grooming tools**, like a flat iron, clipper, or hair dryer
-  **Cleaning tools**, like a vacuum, steam cleaner, or air purifier

Once you know what you want to clean, look up the manual. (This is an important step!) Try to find a sticker or label that tells you the make and model of your appliance, drop it into Google like “Dyson DC-17 manual” to find and read or watch the manufacturer’s instructions for cleaning your appliance. You can follow these instructions to the letter, if you’d like, but your main goal here is to uncover morsels of “oh, that’s how you do that!” details that’ll let you get a really deep clean.

If you can’t locate a manual, or the manual’s instructions feel overwhelming, no problem! Here are some instructions for cleaning some home appliances. If you don’t see your target on this list, great instructions are only a search away.
